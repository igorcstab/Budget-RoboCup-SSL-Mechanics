 # Operation

A SSL bot during the competition, testing or maintenance has some operation particularities that should be met in the scope of hardware design in order to avoid headaches and make our lives easier. Those are being able to:

- Access the electronics and battery quickly;
- Repair a system without rendering the whole robot inoperative;
- Change the unified vision blobs easily;
- Have as little cable harness as possible (and organizing them, obviously);
- Keep a low center of gravity and be as lightweight as possible;

It doesn't look like much but those atributes will produce a lot of requisites and force design decisions. Pay attention to the fact each of those itens tells us **what** to do but not **how** and from there will rise those requisites/design decisions.
